        explanation="Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit value for `android:exported` when the corresponding component has an intent filter defined.

For launch activities, this should be set to true; otherwise, the app will fail to launch.&#xA;&#xA;Previously, `android:exported` for components without any intent filters present used to default to `false`, and when intent filters were present, the default was `true`. Defaults which change value based on other values are confusing and lead to apps accidentally exporting components as a side-effect of adding intent filters. This is a security risk, and we have made this change to avoid introducing accidental vulnerabilities.&#xA;&#xA;While the default without intent filters remains unchanged, it is now required to explicitly specify a value when intent filters are present. Any app failing to meet this requirement will fail to install on any Android version after Android 11.&#xA;&#xA;We recommend setting `android:exported` to false (even on previous versions of Android prior to this requirement) unless you have a good reason to export a particular component."

        explanation="Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high). This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as `drawable-hdpi`.&#xA;&#xA;Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards"
