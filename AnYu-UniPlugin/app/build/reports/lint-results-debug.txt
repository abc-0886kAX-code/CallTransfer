   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

D:\WorkSpace\Android\CallTransfer\AnYu-UniPlugin\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:33: Warning: As of Android 12, android:exported must be set; use true to make the activity available to other apps, and false otherwise. [IntentFilterExportedReceiver]

D:\WorkSpace\Android\CallTransfer\AnYu-UniPlugin\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:59: Warning: As of Android 12, android:exported must be set; use true to make the activity available to other apps, and false otherwise. [IntentFilterExportedReceiver]
        <activity
         ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "IntentFilterExportedReceiver":
   Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit
   value for android:exported when the corresponding component has an intent
   filter defined. Otherwise, installation will fail. Set it to true to make
   this activity accessible to other apps, and false to limit it to be used
   only by this app or the OS. For launch activities, this should be set to
   true; otherwise, the app will fail to launch.

   Previously, android:exported for components without any intent filters
   present used to default to false, and when intent filters were present, the
   default was true. Defaults which change value based on other values are
   confusing and lead to apps accidentally exporting components as a
   side-effect of adding intent filters. This is a security risk, and we have
   made this change to avoid introducing accidental vulnerabilities.

   While the default without intent filters remains unchanged, it is now
   required to explicitly specify a value when intent filters are present. Any
   app failing to meet this requirement will fail to install on any Android
   version after Android 11.

   We recommend setting android:exported to false (even on previous versions
   of Android prior to this requirement) unless you have a good reason to
   export a particular component.

D:\WorkSpace\Android\CallTransfer\AnYu-UniPlugin\app\build.gradle:9: Error: Google Play requires that apps target API level 30 or higher.
 [ExpiredTargetSdkVersion]
        targetSdkVersion 28 //建议此属性值设为21 io.dcloud.PandoraEntry 作为apk入口时   必须设置 targetSDKVersion>=21 沉浸式才生效
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ExpiredTargetSdkVersion":
   As of the second half of 2018, Google Play requires that new apps and app
   updates target API level 26 or higher.

   Configuring your app to target a recent API level ensures that users
   benefit from significant security and performance improvements, while still
   allowing your app to run on older Android versions (down to the
   minSdkVersion).

   To update your targetSdkVersion, follow the steps from "Meeting Google Play
   requirements for target API level",

D:\WorkSpace\Android\CallTransfer\AnYu-UniPlugin\app\src\main\res\drawable-xxhdpi\push.png: Warning: The resource R.drawable.push appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
D:\WorkSpace\Android\CallTransfer\AnYu-UniPlugin\app\src\main\res\drawable-xxhdpi\splash.png: Warning: The resource R.drawable.splash appears to be unused [UnusedResources]

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.

D:\WorkSpace\Android\CallTransfer\AnYu-UniPlugin\app\src\main\res: Warning: Missing density variation folders in D:\WorkSpace\Android\CallTransfer\AnYu-UniPlugin\app\src\main\res: drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi, drawable-xhdpi [IconMissingDensityFolder]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconMissingDensityFolder":
   Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major
   screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high).
   This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as
   drawable-hdpi.

   Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi
   density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable
   ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true. For more information on current density
   usage, see https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards
